# Aim: To Study and Implement Classes and Objects.

# Tool: VS CODE.

# Theory: 

•	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of thinking about and organizing code for maximum reusability. 
•	With this type of programming, a program comprises objects that can interact with the user, other objects, or other programs. 
This makes programs more efficient and easier to understand.
•	Programs made with object-oriented programming are well-organized. 
•	Since relative data and functions are grouped in the same object, it is simple to find what you're looking for and understand the code's fundamental purpose. 
•	Developers new to the project or those revisiting code they have not seen in a while can adapt much faster. 
•	When code is divided into manageable pieces this way, you can avoid overwhelmingly large and complicated files.
